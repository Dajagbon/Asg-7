# Asg-7

**a) Purpose of the Program(s)**: The purpose of the probability program is to take a dice configuration, and a numeric value as input. The function should then calculate the probability of rolling a series of numbers on the dice that matches or exceeds the input value (ie. ‘1d6’, 3, would return 4/6). 

The purpose of the combinatorics program is to take a string as input and generate a list of all permutations of the characters used in that string. For example, the input ‘AB’ would return ‘AB’ and ‘BA’. 

**b) Input:** The probability program's input is the dice configuration and the numeric value provided by the information. The combinatorics program's input is the string provided by the information.

**c) Expected Output:** The probability program's output is a probability from the given information. The combinatorics program is the rearranged permutation words from the given information. 

**d) Type of Execution:** The type(s) of execution for the probability and combinatorics program is Conditional execution.

**e) Possible Improvements:** The probability program could be improved by: Allowing the def function to take the number of dice and the target value as arguments or by adding more clarity to my variable names. 

The combinatorics program could be improved by: Using more descriptive variable names.
